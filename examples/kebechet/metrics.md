# Monitoring Metrics

Based on the type of application, we can define relevant metrics that help developers, product owners, users etc gain more insights regarding the performance, operation, usage of the application. Metrics can be categorized based on the different personas we would like to target such as:

- `Product Owner` - Project's key stakeholder who communicate the vision of the application to the team/stakeholders and ensure the feasibility of the application with respect to business objectives
- `Project Manager` - Supervisors of other teams who would like to adopt the application for their use-cases and oversee the successful delivery of the application
- `Technical Architect` -  Provides technical feasibility of requirements, advise on technology choices and manage the technical roadmap
- `Operations` - Primarily focused on application management, application maintenance and instrumental in automation of application development processes
- `Analyst` - Work with both developers and users to assess the product, utilizing data and user feedback to suggest improvements. Responsible for analyzing metrics to continually improve the application
- `Users` - Users interacting with the application (who we are building the product for) and this can probably have sub categories for the different type of users
