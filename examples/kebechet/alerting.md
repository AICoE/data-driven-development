# Alerting

Alerting on metrics is essential to monitoring. They allow you to spot problems anywhere in your infrastructure, application, etc so that you can rapidly identify their causes and minimize service degradation and disruption. An alert should communicate something specific about your systems such as â€œ90% of all web requests are taking more than 0.5s to process and respond." Receiving these alerts allows you to respond quickly to issues and provide better service, and it also saves time by freeing you from continual manual inspection of metrics.

You can get notified of these alerts through emails, Slack etc. Our team uses the [GitHub Alertmanager](https://github.com/m-lab/alertmanager-github-receiver) to handle all the alerts. The GitHub Alertmanager is a webhook receiver that creates GitHub issues from alerts. To learn more about setting up the GitHub Alertmanager, you can refer to our [documentation](https://www.operate-first.cloud/operations/sre/incident-management/github-receiver-setup.md).
