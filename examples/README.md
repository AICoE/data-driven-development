# Monitoring Applications

Monitoring applications is an essential piece of the puzzle to ensuring your infrastructure stays operational, you know how your applications are running, how they’re being utilized, and how they’re growing. With this data, you can more easily find problems with your applications, know that your users are able to utilize and operate the applications smoothly and take decisions to further improve the functionality of the applications.

As we onboard more applications, it can get tricky to establish and maintain an effective monitoring procedure. With infrastructure monitoring continuing to evolve, you need monitoring tools that can adapt to those changes. Hence, it is important to have a monitoring solution that is designed to tackle the existing challenges head-on and also have the flexibility to tackle future issues.

Implementing a monitoring solution is dependent on the type of application/service, its functionality, the metrics we would like to track and the technical components involved. To help teams establish and improve their monitoring process, we have created **monitoring guides** by taking a few applications/services managed by our team as examples. The monitoring guide lists out the various pieces that need to be considered when implementing a monitoring solution such as the **technical infrastructure, collection and storage of metrics, alerting on metrics, visualization of metrics through dashboards etc**.

You can reference these monitoring guides by exploring some of our example applications such as [Kebechet](https://github.com/AICoE/data-driven-development/tree/main/examples/kebechet) and adopt some of the best practices for your team!
